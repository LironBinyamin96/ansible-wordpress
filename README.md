## Ansible WordPress+Nginx+PHP-FPM Deployment

This is an ansible role forked from https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples to show how an advanced Ansible playbook can be installed to a server being provisioned by mist.io. The playbooks will configure MySQL, WordPress, Nginx, and PHP-FPM. When the run is complete, you can hit access server to begin the WordPress configuration.

- To be deployed on CentOS/RHEL 6.x hosts. Tested on CentOS 6.7 64bit on DigitalOcean
